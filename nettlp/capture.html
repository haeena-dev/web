	<h2> Overview </h2>

	<p>
	  PCIe topologies and their communication models are flexible:
	  CPU-to-Device and Device-to-Device. By exploiting
	  Device-to-Device PCIe communications, as known as
	  Peer-to-Peer DMA (P2P DMA), on a NetTLP platform, we can
	  observe TLPs sent from commercial peripherals.

	<h3> Capturing TLPs in NetTLP </h3>

	<p>
	  For capturing TLPs sent from peripherals by NetTLP, it is
	  necessary to change destinations of DMAs from the
	  peripheral: from main memory to BAR4 of the NetTLP
	  adapter. It requires modifications for device drivers, but
	  Linux provides helpers for such purposes
	  (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/pci/p2pdma.html">PCI
	  Peer-to-Peer DMA Support &mdash; The Linux Kernel
	  documentation</a>)
	</p>

	<p>
	  Once TLPs go out into IP networks, we can capture the TLPs
	  by tcpdump. Figure 1 shows an overview of a setup for
	  capturing TLPs. An easy way to capture TLPs encapsulated in
	  IP is to run tcpdump on a device host. Capturing TLPs on the
	  device host is sufficient to observe the contents of the
	  TLPs.  On the other hand, using port mirroring and another
	  box enables observing them without affecting the performance
	  of software PCIe devices on the device host from the
	  software view. Moreover, using hardware RX time stamping on
	  the box brings microsecond-scale observation for PCIe
	  transactions.

	<h3> Examples </h3>

	<p>
	  Figure 2 shows captured TLPs of two types of NICs: Intel
	  X520 10Gbps NIC and Intel XL710 40 Gbps NIC. It is captured
	  by port mirroring and hardware RX time stamping at a Linux
	  box. Both NICs tried to send 32 1500-byte packets with DMA
	  Read, and the packets were on the BAR4 of the NetTLP adapter
	  where psmem at the device host was associated.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In this experiment, we prepared Linux kernel 4.20.2 with the
	  PCI_P2PDMA option that enables the P2P DMA support.
	  Moreover, for changing destinations of DMA reads from the
	  NICs on the main memory to the BAR4 on the NetTLP adapter,
	  we used netmap and modified ixgbe and i40e netmap drivers.

	As shown, X520 and XL710 utilize TLP tag fields differently
	for achieving their desired bandwidth, for example.
