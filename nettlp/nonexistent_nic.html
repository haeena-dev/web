	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	  On the NetTLP platform, you can develop your own PCIe
	  devices in software interacting with hardware root complex.
	  For an exmaple of such a software device, we introduce an
	  implementation of <strong> simple NIC</strong>. The simple
	  NIC was originally introduced
	  by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/projects/pcie-bench/">pcie-bench</a>. The
	  original simple NIC is a theoretical model of a simplistic
	  Ethernet NIC, which does not have any performance
	  optimizations and complicated DMA interfaces, for
	  understanding PCIe interactions and calucating bandwidth.
	  NetTLP enables implementing such models of PCIe devices in
	  software and confirming whether the models actually work
	  with existent hardware root complex. In other words, the
	  PCIe devices are certainly implemented in software, but they
	  perform as actual devices for physical root complxes.
	  Moreover, its PCIe transactions can be observed by tcpdump.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The PCIe interactions of the simple NIC model are described in
	  <a href="https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model">the
	  model's implementation</a>, actually,
	  here: <a href="https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model/blob/master/model/simple_nic.py">https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model/blob/master/model/simple_nic.py</a>. Our
	  simple NIC implementation in NetTLP follows the steps of the
	  PCIe interactions described in the source code. Anyway, this
	  page focuses on how to setup and run the simple NIC on the
	  NetTLP platform.

	<h2> Setup </h2>

	<p>
	  To run the simple NIC, please setup a NetTLP environment
	  following the <a href="setup.html">instruction</a> and
	  confirm <a href="example_apps.html">the exmaple applications
	  work</a>.
	</p>

	<p> The simple NIC implementation is composed of two
	  components: (1) a device driver for the NetTLP adapter and
	  (2) the software device implementation for simple NIC using
	  LibTLP. The driver treats the NetTLP adapter as an physical
	  Ethernet NIC and create a netdevice interface (like usual
	  Ethrenet interfaces in Linux as ifconfig command
	  shows). Packets transmitted to the interface are delivered
	  to the device host as TLPs over the PCIe links between the
	  root complex and the NetTLP adapter, and the Ethernet link
	  between the adapter host and device host. The simple NIC
	  implementation receives the TLPs using LibTLP and send the
	  packets to a tap interface.

	<p>
	  Figure 1 shows an exmaple setup of the simple NIC. Descriptions
	  of network interfaces in the figure are:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Adapter Host</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      eth0: just a management network. A requirement is the
	      adapter host must be able to communicate with the device
	      host via this link.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      eth2: netdevice interface for the simple NIC. The simple
	      NIC driver for the NetTLP adapter creates this
	      interface. Packets to eth2 are deliverred to the device
	      host by encapsulating TLPs in Ethernet via the 10G
	      Ethernet link between the adapter and the device host.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <li>Device Host</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      eth0: just a management network. A requirement is the
	      device host must be able to communicate with the adapter
	      host via this link.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      eth1: a netdevice interface to receive and send TLPs
	      with the NetTLP adapter. It is eth1 in the <a href="setup.html">
		setup instruction</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      tap0: the actual ethernet port of the simple NIC. the
	      simple NIC process on the device host creates this tap
	      interface. Packets transmitted to the eth2 (the NetTLP
	      adapter) on the device host are transmitted to this tap
	      interface on the device host. As well as transmission,
	      packets received by the tap0 are received by eth2 on the
	      adapter host.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      br0: just a target interface to send ping. The tap0 is
	      enslaved by the br0. As a result, packets transmitted to
	      the eth2 on the adapter host are transmitted to the tap0
	      and received by the br0. This means that we can ping
	      between the eth2 on the adapter host (10.0.0.1) and br0
	      on the device host (10.0.0.2).
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</ul>
