      <section>
	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	  On the NetTLP platform, you can develop your PCIe devices in
	  software interacting with hardware root complex.  For an
	  exmaple of such a software device, we introduce an
	  implementation of <strong> simple NIC</strong>. The simple
	  NIC, originally introduced
	  by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/projects/pcie-bench/">pcie-bench</a>,
	  is a theoretical model of a simplistic Ethernet NIC, which
	  does not have any performance optimizations and complicated
	  DMA interfaces, for understanding PCIe interactions and
	  calucating bandwidth.  NetTLP enables implementing such
	  models of PCIe devices in software and confirming whether
	  the models actually work with existent hardware root
	  complex. In other words, the PCIe devices are certainly
	  implemented in software, but they perform as actual devices
	  for physical root complxes. Moreover, their PCIe
	  transactions can be observed by tcpdump.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The PCIe interactions of the simple NIC model are described in
	  <a href="https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model">the
	  model's implementation</a>, actually,
	  here: <a href="https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model/blob/master/model/simple_nic.py">https://github.com/pcie-bench/pcie-model/blob/master/model/simple_nic.py</a>. Our
	  simple NIC implementation in NetTLP follows the steps of the
	  PCIe interactions described in the source code. Anyway, this
	  page focuses on how to setup and run the simple NIC on the
	  NetTLP platform.
	</p>

      </section>

      <section>
	<h2> Setup </h2>

	<p>
	  To run the simple NIC, please setup a NetTLP environment
	  following the <a href="setup.html">instruction</a> and
	  confirm <a href="example_apps.html">the exmaple applications
	  work</a>.
	</p>

	<p> The simple NIC implementation is composed of two
	  components among both adapter and device hosts: (1) a device
	  driver for the NetTLP adapter and (2) the software device
	  implementation for simple NIC using LibTLP. The driver
	  treats the NetTLP adapter as an physical Ethernet NIC and
	  create a netdevice interface (like usual Ethrenet interfaces
	  in Linux as ifconfig command shows). Packets transmitted to
	  the interface are delivered to the device host as TLPs over
	  the PCIe links between the root complex and the NetTLP
	  adapter, and the Ethernet link between the adapter host and
	  device host. The simple NIC implementation receives the TLPs
	  using LibTLP and send the packets to a tap interface.
	</p>

	    <img src="fig/simple-nic-setup.png"/></a>
          <p>Figure 1: Overview of an environment to run the simple NIC.</p>
        </div>

	<p>
	  Figure 1 shows an exmaple setup of the simple NIC. Descriptions
	  of network interfaces in the figure are:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Adapter Host</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      eth0: just a management network. A requirement is the
	      adapter host must be able to communicate with the device
	      host via this link.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      eth2: netdevice interface for the simple NIC. The simple
	      NIC driver for the NetTLP adapter creates this
	      interface. Packets transmitted to eth2 are deliverred to
	      the device host by encapsulating TLPs in Ethernet via
	      the 10G Ethernet link between the adapter and the device
	      host.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <li>Device Host</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      eth0: just a management network. A requirement is the
	      device host must be able to communicate with the adapter
	      host via this link.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      eth1: a netdevice interface to receive and send TLPs
	      with the NetTLP adapter. It is eth1 in
	      the <a href="setup.html"> setup instruction</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      tap0: the actual ethernet port of the simple NIC. the
	      simple NIC process on the device host creates this tap
	      interface. Packets transmitted to eth2 (the NetTLP
	      adapter) on the device host are transmitted from this
	      tap interface on the device host. As well as the
	      transmission, packets received by tap0 are received by
	      eth2 on the adapter host.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      br0: just a target interface to send ping. tap0 is
	      enslaved by br0. As a result, packets transmitted to
	      eth2 on the adapter host are transmitted from tap0 and
	      received by br0. This means that we can ping between
	      eth2 on the adapter host (10.0.0.1) and br0 on the
	      device host (10.0.0.2).
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  The implementation of simple NIC, which is illustrated as
	  simple-nic in Figure 1, is responsible for the substance of
	  the NIC represented as eth2 on the device host.  simple-nic
	  receives and sends TLPs from and to the NetTLP adapter
	  through LibTLP. The interactions between simple-nic and the
	  NetTLP adapter fully follow the simple NIC model, and they
	  can be observed by tcpdump at the 10G Ethernet link.
