	<h2> What is NetTLP? </h2>
	<p>
		NetTLP is a development platform for software PCIe devices that can interact with hardware root complexes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Developers can program their own PCIe devices with IP packet processing and debug the DMA communication with powerful network tools like tcpdump and wireshark.
		Software PCIe devices work in various PCIe topologies, such as CPU-to-Device, Device-to-Device, and Remote DMA.
		For example, DMA communication of NIC or NVMe devices can be captured by NetTLP's memory device (pseudo memory device) set in the DMA region.
		NetTLP provides powerful visibility into PCIe communication.

	<p>
	  On the NetTLP platform, substances of PCIe devices are
	  implemented as software on top of a library, called LibTLP.
	  LibTLP, which is a software implementation of PCIe
	  Transaction Layer, provides a well-abstracted DMA API for
	  the software devices, and sends and receives PCIe
	  Transaction Layer Packetes (TLPs) over UDP/IP/Ethernet. The
	  NetTLP adapter installed on a distant host receives TLPs
	  from the software device, and then sends the TLPs to the
	  root complex through the physical PCIe interconnect. TLPs
	  sent from the root complex to the NetTLP adapter are
	  delivered to the software device through the Ethernet link
	  by encapsulating TLPs in UDP/IP/Ethernet likewise.
	</p>

	<p>
	  So, you can implement your PCIe devices in software
	  interacting with hardware root complexes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  And, you can observe their interactions by powerful IP
	  networking tools like tcpdump and wireshark.
