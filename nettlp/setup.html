	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	  A NetTLP platform is composed of two hosts: <strong>adapter
	    host</strong> and <strong>device host</strong>. An adapter
	    host has at least one FPGA-based NetTLP adapter and a
	    device host performs software device, which is the
	    substance of the NetTLP adapter on the adapter host.  The
	    hosts are connected by 10Gbps Ethernet link between the
	    NetTLP adapter and a normal 10Gbps NIC on the device host.
	</p>

	<h2> Setup adapter host </h2>

	<h3> Requirement of adapter host </h3>
	<ul> 
	  <li> OS: Ubuntu 18.04 </li>
	  <li> x1 PCIe Gen2 x16 slot </li>
	  <li> Vivado XXXX (<strong>TBD</strong>) </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  Install a NetTLP adapter to a PCIe slot, program the adapter
	  via Vivado. After booting the adapter host, you can see a
	  device with vendor ID 3776:8022.
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-shell-session">$ lspci -d 3776:8022
1b:00.0 Memory controller: Device 3776:8022

$ sudo lspci -v -d 3776:8022
1b:00.0 Memory controller: Device 3776:8022
	Subsystem: Device 3776:8022
	Flags: fast devsel, NUMA node 0

	Memory at a0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [disabled] [size=256M]
	Memory at b0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [disabled] [size=256M]
	Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
	Capabilities: [60] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
	Capabilities: [9c] MSI-X: Enable- Count=22 Masked-
	Capabilities: [100] Device Serial Number 00-00-00-01-01-00-0a-35</code></pre>

	<p>
	  The current NetTLP adapter (v0.17) has three Base Address
	  Registers (BAR). BAR0 is used to store adapter specific
	  information (i.e., MAC address and IP address), and BAR2 is
	  sued to store MSI-X table. BAR4 is quite special:
	  Transaction Layer Packets (TLPs) to BAR are encapsulated in
	  Ethernet, IP, and UDP headers, and transmitted to the device
	  host via the 10Gbps Ethernet Link. In the above example,
	  memory accesses to 0xb0000000-0xbfffffff in the MMIO space
	  are delivered to the device host.
	</p>

	<h2> Setup device host </h2>

	<h3> Requirement of adapter host </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li> OS: Ubuntu 18.04 </li>
	  <li> x1 10Gbps Ethernet port </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  Connect the device host to the NetTLP adapter on the adapter
	  host by 10Gbps Ethernet link. The NetTLP adapter always
	  sends light during board power is on, so that
	  only <code class="inline">ip link set dev ethX up</code> is
	  required to bring the link up.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Next step is to setup a static ARP entry. The current
	  implementation of NetTLP adapter (v0.17) does not respond to
	  ARP request. Thus, the device host needs to have a static
	  ARP entry for the connected NetTLP adapter.
